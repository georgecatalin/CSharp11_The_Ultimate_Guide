Taks Parallel Library (TPL) is the response to the drawbacks of the original Threading concepts.
TPL is an API (set of classes and methods) that provide functionality to support concurrency, parallelism and asynchronous programming.
TPL uses a high level implementation of Threads, using Thread Pool. Tasks are placed in Queue and managed to fit into the Thread Pool.

Stages of tasks:
1. Task creation
2. Task Scheduling
3. Thread Pool
4. Concurrency

Advantages of the TPL
1. Abstraction -> simplify the low level details associated with MultiThreading management.
2. Efficiency -> achieved with the Task Scheduler
3. Cancellation -> graceful termination of execution
4. Asynchronous programming
5. Task continuation -> establish methods to execute when the task completes, gets an exception
6. Parallelism in execution
