The drawbacks of Threads against the use of TPL (Task Parallel Library) split in:

1. Complexity
To use threading, the developer has to create the threads, and manage aspects like thread synchronisation and thread signaling which makes the code prone to errors and exceptions.


2. Scalability
Threads are heavyweight elements, opposite to Tasks. Threads consume resource like CPU and memory.

3. Cancellation
Cancellation is the action of gracefully stoping an ongoing operation, and this is achieved with difficulty and inefficiently with Threads

4. Async programming
By default Threads block themselves on the I/O resource they consume.

4. Parallelization
With Threads it is not possible to achieve parallelization of work.
